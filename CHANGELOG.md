# Changelog

Notable changes to the `suite` CLI. Newest first.

The version in `package.json` is the single source of truth — `suite --version`,
the POSIX launcher and `install.sh`'s banner all read it. **Bump it in the same
PR as the change**, so that an installed CLI's version answers the only question
that matters in the field: is this one newer than what I had?

Minor for a new capability or a changed default; patch for a fix that changes no
behaviour anyone was relying on.

## 0.4.0

- **`suite hermes` and `suite openclaw`: stamp a Hermes or OpenClaw agent root
  Suite-ready, then run its gateway in a persistent tmux session.** Each agent's
  harness state lives under its root, never in `~/.hermes` or `~/.openclaw`,
  and neither verb installs, starts or restarts a daemon. The runtime token is
  accepted only by reference (`--token-ref file:<path>` or
  `--token-ref keychain:<item> --keychain-service <svc>`); a literal is refused.
- **`suite hermes` stamps a lean toolset for the Suite platform by default.**
  It sets `platform_toolsets.startup_suite: [hermes-webhook]` (web, vision and
  clarify, plus every enabled MCP server, so the Suite bridge stays) and no
  other toolset key. The reasons: a channel agent's capabilities come through
  the Suite MCP bundle, shell and file tools widen what untrusted chat can
  reach, and Hermes's own default makes the first prompt 16,633 tokens, which
  a 16K-context model cannot answer. `--full-toolset` opts out, removing the
  key only when it holds exactly that lean list. An operator's own value is
  never overwritten.
- **Stamp results report what happened, not what was planned.** Each action
  carries `applied`; a failed run lists the writes it never reached as
  `applied: false`, and a harness install that ran before a refusal is still
  listed. A run that fails after its first write records `fail` in
  `.suite-stamp.json`, so `suite status` and `--gateway-only` never act on an
  older `pass`.
- **A signalled gateway wrapper takes its gateway down.** The session exec
  forwards SIGTERM and SIGHUP (and SIGINT when no terminal delivered it) to the
  child and waits for it, instead of leaving it orphaned.
- **`--stamp-only` is a stable machine contract** for callers such as core's
  installer `setup channel` step: one JSON document on stdout
  (`contract_version: 1`, additive changes only), and exit codes 0 ok, 1 failed,
  2 refused, 3 blocked on a human. The README's "Stamp contract" section is the
  reference, and a test keeps it in step with what the code emits.
- **`suite status` lists stamped agents** with kind, root, session state and the
  last stamp verdict. A gateway that died takes its tmux session with it, so a
  recorded agent that is not running reads `stale`, not absent. Sessions of
  other kinds are now checked for their own process (`dsh`, `hermes`,
  `openclaw-gateway`), so they are no longer reported as a dead Claude.
- **The restore roster records `hermes` and `openclaw` agents**, and
  `suite restore --adopt` recognises their gateway sessions.

## 0.3.0

- **`suite init` no longer leaves an agent without the conventions just because
  the repo ships its own `CLAUDE.md`.** That filename carries two different
  documents — an agent's brief and a project's codebase guide — and `exists`
  cannot tell them apart, so in most mature repos `init` skipped, printed
  `present, left alone`, and the agent received none of the conventions with
  nothing saying so. An existing `CLAUDE.md` is still **never** written to.
  Instead the conventions go to `SUITE_CONVENTIONS.md`, a file the CLI owns
  outright and rewrites on every run, and `init` names what the existing file is
  missing plus the one line (`@SUITE_CONVENTIONS.md`) that loads it. A
  `CLAUDE.md` that already states the conventions gets no second file.

## 0.2.0

- **`suite init` seeds a starting `CLAUDE.md`** for new Suite agents — how a
  runtime is expected to behave on the platform, distilled from the briefs
  already in use. An existing file is never overwritten; a re-run reports
  `present, left alone`. The template is static and carries no identifiers.
- **Sessions are created with tmux mouse mode on**, scoped to the session and
  never `-g`. Without it, tmux turns a wheel event inside a full-screen app into
  arrow keys, so scrolling an agent walks its input history instead of its
  scrollback. New sessions only — reattaching never re-configures a session you
  are already working in. Note mouse mode also routes click-drag to tmux's
  selection, so a native selection needs the terminal's override modifier
  (Option on macOS).
- `--session` is wired through, so the flag the README documents exists.

## 0.1.0

First tagged version: `init`, `claude`, `doctor`, `status`, `update`, the POSIX
launcher and `install.sh`.
